## Understanding Our Customer

### Who They Are

Pop-up shop staff are typically working in temporary retail environments such as:

- Festival and event booths
- Seasonal market stalls
- Promotional pop-up stores
- Limited-time brand experiences
- Mobile retail operations

### Their Key Challenges

1. **Space Constraints**: Limited counter space makes bulky traditional POS systems impractical
2. **Mobility Requirements**: Staff need to move around and assist customers anywhere in the space
3. **Quick Setup**: Pop-up shops require rapid deployment and takedown
4. **Technical Simplicity**: Staff may have varying levels of technical expertise
5. **Time Pressure**: High-traffic events demand fast transaction processing
6. **Cost Sensitivity**: Temporary operations need affordable solutions without long-term commitments
7. **Internet Reliability**: Events may have inconsistent network connectivity
